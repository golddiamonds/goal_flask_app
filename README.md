goal_flask_app
==============

A goal or to-do list web app using the Flask web framework and a MySQL backend.

This was originally created for use on PythonAnywhere.com, but could be used on any webserver
if you have the necessary software installed. It is fully functional, but has plenty of room
for feature growth.
